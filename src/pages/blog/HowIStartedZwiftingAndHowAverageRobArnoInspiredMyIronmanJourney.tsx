          I want to talk about how I started Zwifting, where the inspiration came from, and why it honestly changed my life more than I ever expected.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A big part of this story comes down to two people: AverageRob and Arno.
        </p>

      {/* Discovering the series */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Discovering the AverageRob & Arno Series</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At some point, I started watching AverageRob on YouTube, and I came across the series he did together with Arno. I watched Episode 1, then Episode 2, then 3, and eventually 4.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And I didn't just watch them once.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I watched these episodes while I was Zwifting.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I'd be riding, sweating, pushing through workouts, and at the same time watching their journey unfold on screen. It became this perfect mix of entertainment, motivation, and suffering — the good kind.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That series honestly hit me harder than I expected.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          (This is where I'll embed Episode 1–4 in the article, because I genuinely recommend watching all of them in order.)

      {/* Why their story hit */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Their Story Hit So Hard</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What really inspired me was how real it all felt.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Arno, especially, had a really hard time at points. You could see the struggle. You could see the doubt. You could see that it wasn't easy — at all.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At the same time, both Arno and Rob could swim really well.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          And swimming is hard for me. It's still my weakest discipline.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Instead of discouraging me, that actually motivated me even more. Watching people push through something difficult, but still keep going, made me think:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-lg">
          "Okay. Maybe I can do this too."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That's when the idea of doing a Half Ironman first — and eventually a full Ironman — really started to feel real.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Not just a crazy thought.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          But an actual goal.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Music and RuneScape */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Music, the Vibe, and RuneScape Nostalgia</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Another thing that made the series so special was the music.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The soundtrack was amazing. Very unique. And at one point, I realized something wild:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          They were using RuneScape music.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That hit me straight in the heart.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I actually messaged Rob (AverageRob) to tell him that I loved the music choice and that I played RuneScape too.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Because here's the thing:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          I used to be a really fat gamer, sitting around playing RuneScape all day.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Seeing that connection — RuneScape music playing while I'm sweating on a bike, chasing endurance goals — felt almost poetic.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* From gamer to zwifter */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">From Gamer to Zwifter: Losing Weight and Getting in Shape</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift genuinely helped me lose weight and get in shape.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">It gave me structure.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It gave me something to show up for.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And it gave me a way to suffer that actually felt meaningful.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Instead of just "training," I had something to focus on:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>The ride</li>
          <li>The numbers</li>
          <li>The videos</li>
          <li>The story unfolding on screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Suddenly, I wasn't just exercising.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          I was training.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* What to watch */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What I Watch While Zwifting (And Why It Works)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you ever get bored while Zwifting — especially during long rides — I really recommend two things:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">1. Watch These YouTube Episodes</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The AverageRob & Arno episodes (1–4) are perfect for Zwift.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          They're motivating, emotional, and relatable.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I honestly recommend them to anyone who's Zwifting, especially if you're training for something big.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">2. Watch Movies During Steady Efforts</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">When I'm doing:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Free riding</li>
          <li>Long endurance rides</li>
          <li>Constant power workouts (like holding 170 watts)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">I love watching movies.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Some of my favorites:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>The Wolf of Wall Street</li>
          <li>The Big Short</li>
          <li>Other business or motivation-heavy movies</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you're holding steady power, you can just keep pushing the pedals and let the movie flow. Time passes insanely fast. Before you know it, the workout is done.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">You get into this rhythm where:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Legs are working</li>
          <li>Mind is engaged</li>
          <li>Suffering feels manageable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      {/* Why recommend */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why I Recommend This to Anyone Zwifting</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">If you're:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Training for a Half Ironman</li>
          <li>Dreaming about an Ironman</li>
          <li>Trying to lose weight</li>
          <li>Or just struggling to stay consistent</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Then I really recommend doing what I did:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Ride on Zwift</li>
          <li>Watch inspiring content</li>
          <li>Let the stories pull you forward</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For me, that combination completely changed my mindset.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Final thoughts */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwifting wasn't just cycling indoors for me.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">It became:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>A way out of old habits</li>
          <li>A bridge from gaming to training</li>
          <li>A path toward endurance sports and Ironman goals</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And a huge part of that came from watching AverageRob and Arno suffer, push through, and keep going — right there on my screen while I was doing the same.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">If you're ever bored on Zwift, or lacking motivation:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Watch these episodes</li>
          <li>Or throw on a movie</li>
          <li>And just keep pedaling</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
          You'll be surprised how far it can take you.
        </p>
