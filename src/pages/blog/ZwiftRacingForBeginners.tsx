        <p className="mb-4">
          The single most useful thing anyone can tell you before your first Zwift race is that the start is far
          harder than the rest of it, and that almost everyone gets it wrong.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A Zwift race does not roll out. The clock hits zero and the entire field sprints, because the pack sorts
          itself in the first few minutes and being dropped in that window means riding alone for the rest of the
          event. The result is that a race you expected to be a hard hour begins with two to five minutes at close
          to your maximum, and that opening is what shocks people rather than the distance{" "}

          What follows covers how the categories work, what to do in that opening kilometre, when a power-up is
          worth holding rather than spending, and how the finish is actually decided. It assumes you can already
          ride for an hour and that you have never pinned on a number.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understand Race Categories</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift races are typically divided into categories (A, B, C, D, etc.) based on rider ability, usually measured in watts per kilogram (W/kg). <strong>Choosing the right category is super important.</strong> If you're new, you'll likely be in Category D or C. For example, Cat D might be for riders below ~2.5 W/kg FTP, Cat C for ~2.5-3.2 W/kg, and so on (exact cutoffs can vary, and Zwift's new "Racing Score" system is refining this){" "}
          <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/zwift-racing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">

          {" "}
          <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/zwift-racing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[3]</em>
          </a>
          . Don't ego-pick a higher cat; you'll just suffer and get dropped by much stronger riders. It's more fun and fair to race people at your level. Zwift now has <strong>category enforcement</strong> in many races, meaning the game will auto-restrict you to the category matching your abilities{" "}
          <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/zwift-racing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[4]</em>
          </a>
          . When you go to the Events list, look for a race and see the categories listed - enter the one that corresponds to your current fitness. As you improve, you can move up categories. But for that first race, stick to your lane and you'll have a much better experience (no one likes getting blasted off the back in the first 2 minutes).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Before the Race - Preparation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Turning up prepared matters more here than it does for a training ride. <strong>Do a warm-up.</strong> Zwift races notoriously start fast (more on that in a second), so you don't want your first hard effort to be when the gun goes off. A 10-15 minute warm-up with a few short sprints or hard pulls will get your heart rate up and muscles ready. Many riders will actually join a short event or do a "warm-up ride" in Watopia before hopping into the race pen. Next, check the <strong>course details</strong>. Know the route distance, number of laps, and importantly if there are any significant climbs or sprint points. Zwift Companion app or the event description will tell you the course profile. For example, if it's a flat criterium in Crit City vs. a hilly race up Epic KOM, your strategy and pacing will differ. Knowing that a climb is coming at 10km in means you can position yourself in the group before it hits, etc. Also, ensure your <strong>equipment is ready</strong>: calibrate your trainer if needed, have your water bottle, a towel, and maybe a fan on max. It helps to arrange your screen or pain cave so you can easily see the race - maybe set the camera view to a rear-view to watch others, or whatever you prefer. Lastly, do a quick bio break; races are often 30-45 minutes of non-stop effort, so you will not get a chance later.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Fast and Furious Start</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You are in the start pen, which appears a few minutes before the race, and your heart rate is already up. That is normal. One thing every beginner should know: <strong>Zwift races start <em>extremely</em> fast</strong>. When the clock hits zero, everyone will sprint out of the pen like it's the Tour de France - because if you don't, you risk being dropped immediately as the group forms{" "}
          <a href="https://www.zwift.com/eu-fr/news/24335-race-recon-watopia-road-to-sky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[5]</em>
          </a>
          . It's a quirk of Zwift that there's no "neutral roll-out"; it's full gas from the gun. So be ready to hammer in the first 15-30 seconds. You should ramp up your power in the final few seconds of the countdown (you'll see others already doing it - their avatars might start moving a touch). Don't be alarmed when you're suddenly doing well above your FTP in the first minute - this is normal. The good news: after that initial crazy surge, things usually <strong>settle down</strong> a bit into a steadier pace once the group sorts itself{" "}
          <a href="https://www.zwift.com/eu-fr/news/24335-race-recon-watopia-road-to-sky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[5]</em>
          </a>
          . Your goal at the start is to latch onto the draft of the front pack of your category. If you find yourself drifting back, put in a bit more effort to stay in touch - being in the pack is much easier than dangling off the back fighting wind alone.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Drafting and Pack Tactics</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift simulates drafting, meaning riding behind others significantly cuts your effort for the same speed{" "}
          <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a65267077/zwift-racing-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[6]</em>
          </a>
          . Use this to your advantage. Once the race is underway, try to <strong>stay in the middle of the pack or towards the front third, without actually taking wind on the very front</strong>. Think of it like real racing: you rarely want to be nose in the wind unless attacking. In Zwift, there's no physical risk of touching wheels, so you can stick close. But be mindful of the "sticky draft" effect - sometimes when overtaking a slower rider, the game might momentarily slow you as if you were drafting them. A quick surge in power can break you free. If you're on a hill, draft matters less - expect the pack to string out and people to go harder on climbs. On flats and downhills, draft is huge, so always try to be in someone's slipstream. Positioning: if you see a sharp hill ahead, it can help to move up toward the front before it, because often the pack will split on hills. Being front-ish gives you buffer so if you climb a bit slower, you don't instantly get left behind. Conversely, on a downhill, being in the pack can let you even coast or supertuck (if &gt; -5% grade and you're 58+ km/h, you can stop pedaling and tuck).
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Use Your PowerUps Wisely</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift races allow powerups in many cases (unless the organizer turns them off). A power-up is the icon you pick up passing through a banner, and when you spend it matters more than which one you get. Common ones in races: <strong>Aero (helmet icon)</strong> - makes you more aero for 15s, huge advantage in a sprint or breakaway; <strong>Draft (van icon)</strong> - increases draft effect for 30s, use when sitting in the pack to save energy or on a fast flat; <strong>Feather (feather icon)</strong> - lightens you by 10% for 15s, best used on a steep climb to gain a few seconds or hang on; others like Burrito (no draft for others) or Anvil (heavier on descents) appear only in select events. A beginner tip: don't waste your powerup the second you get it. Have a plan. If there's a climb, save the feather for it. If you have an Aero and the finish line is coming - definitely save it for the final sprint to dramatically increase your chances. Timing an Aero powerup with ~200-250m to go in a sprint can be race-winning, as it significantly reduces drag{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/powerups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[7]</em>
          </a>
          . If you get a draft boost, you might use it when you're barely hanging on in the pack or to pull less on a fast section. Remember, you can only hold one powerup at a time, so use it before the next banner if you want a chance at a new one.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Ride Efficiently</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Efficient racing is <em>key</em> - meaning expending energy only when it counts. A big rookie mistake is "yo-yoing" - constantly sprinting then easing. Instead, aim for smooth power. Follow moves, but don't chase every random flyer that goes off the front (especially in lower cats, people often attack then fizzle). Often, it's best to let someone dangle off the front unless a big group goes or it's near the end. If you find yourself doing the highest watts in the group, ease off - you might be needlessly pulling. As ZwiftInsider notes, finishing a race with the highest average power in the group likely means you wasted energy while others drafted{" "}

            <em>[8]</em>
          </a>
          . Use others to block wind - if you see someone surging past, you can jump on their wheel and get a free ride as they bridge gaps. Also, <strong>maintain focus</strong>{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/zwift-racing-tips-from-a-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[9]</em>
          </a>
          {" "} - it's easy to get distracted at home, but a lapse where you stop pedaling can drop you out of the group. Try to treat it like a real race: for that 30-45 min, you're <em>in the zone</em>. One tip: many racers watch their <strong>heart rate</strong> and know what they can sustain. If you're redlining early, maybe ease slightly and hope the pace normalizes. Expect it to hurt for most of the duration. That is what the event is, and knowing the rest of the field is in the same state makes it considerably easier to tolerate.

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Art of the Finish</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As the race nears the end, scenarios diverge: maybe you're approaching a final climb finish, or it's coming down to a flat sprint with a pack. If you're with others, <strong>position yourself for the finale</strong>. In a flat sprint, being among the front few riders going into the last 200m is ideal - but not <em>at</em> the very front until the last moment. Use the draft of someone and then sling-shot around with your sprint. Launch your sprint a bit earlier than you might outdoors (there's no reaction delay of clipping out or anything - you can go full gas and you won't crash). Also, because everyone starts sprinting, if you leave it too late you might get left. Typically, in a pack, starting a sprint around 150m to go (depending on speed, maybe 10 seconds out) can work, especially if you use an Aero powerup simultaneously. For uphill finishes, anticipate them - if it's say a 500m steep kicker, you might see racers attacking from the base. Be ready to match those surges if you want a shot at the podium. If you're solo or in a small breakaway, you might not need to sprint super hard if you've already dropped others - but always be mindful of someone charging from behind. In lower categories, sometimes riders misjudge and go too early and fade - you can take advantage by pacing a little and then overtaking them in the final meters if you see them fading (kind of like real life when someone bonks).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Community and Fun Factor</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Win or lose, after your first race, give yourself a high-five. It's normal in your first races to maybe not win - or even get dropped. Don't be discouraged. Learn from it: "Okay, I went out too hot" or "I should have been further forward into that climb." Every race you'll get smarter and stronger. The Zwift community is generally super supportive. A lot of races have a chat going - you might see encouraging messages like "Hold on!" or "Good ride everyone" from fellow racers. Embrace that camaraderie. You're suffering together, and that's bonding. Some riders find a team or club - there are many Zwift teams that do weekly races together. You can join those once you get into it. Also, check out <strong>ZwiftPower.com</strong> - it's a third-party site (now officially partnered with Zwift) where you can find detailed results, see your rankings, etc. It's like the results board after a race. You might discover you actually placed decently in your category even if you didn't realize it during the race.

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Benefits of Racing</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift racing is not just about the result - it's one of the best high-intensity workouts you can get. It pushes you in a way that solo training often doesn't. You'll likely break personal records for power in various time ranges. Many beginners report that after doing races, they see improvements in their outdoor riding too - being able to hang in faster group rides, better understanding of drafting, and and a greater tolerance for sustained discomfort. As <em>Bicycling</em> magazine noted, Zwift racing helps you develop pack skills and learn to modulate your efforts and pacing through a race scenario{" "}
          <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a65267077/zwift-racing-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[1]</em>
          </a>
          . Plus, it's a huge motivation boost. Having a race on the calendar can get you on the bike when you might otherwise skip a workout. Competing without the logistics of a real race removes most of the reasons people stop entering them, which is the honest explanation for why the second one usually gets booked the same evening.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your first race will produce numbers you have not seen in training, and it will probably not go well in
          any conventional sense. That is normal and it is not a fitness problem. Race craft is a separate skill
          from fitness, it is learned by racing, and the first few are the tuition fee.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Three things to take into the second one. Warm up properly, because the start punishes cold legs more than
          anything else in the sport. Accept that being in the front third at the two-minute mark is worth more than
          anything you save for later. And judge the race on whether you executed the plan rather than on where you
          finished, because the placing depends on who else entered.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you find that your judgement falls apart in the closing kilometres rather than your legs, that is a
          separate and very common problem, and it is the subject of{" "}
