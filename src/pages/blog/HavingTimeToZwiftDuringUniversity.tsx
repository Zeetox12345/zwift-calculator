          University life is a strange mix of freedom and pressure.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          On paper, you have flexibility. No one tells you exactly when to work. Some days you have big gaps between classes. You might even have whole mornings "free."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In real life, it rarely feels free.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">There are deadlines that sneak up. Group work that never ends. Exams that suddenly become two weeks away. Part-time jobs. Social stuff. Grocery shopping. Laundry. Sleep debt. The mental load of always feeling like you should be studying.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And then you add training.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift is one of the few tools that can actually fit inside student life. It's time-efficient. It doesn't require perfect weather. You can do it at night without worrying about traffic. You can get a quality session done in 45 minutes and still be a functioning human.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But if you're not careful, Zwift can also become the thing you want to do… that you never do. Or you do it for a week, then disappear for a month and feel guilty.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This article is built to solve that.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Not with fake motivation. Not with a strict schedule that ignores exam chaos. Not with a "wake up at 5am and grind" fantasy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is a practical, student-proof system for having time to Zwift during university while still getting your work done and not burning out.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">It includes:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>the "minimum effective dose" approach (so training stays realistic)</li>
          <li>smart ways to place Zwift sessions around lectures, labs, and study blocks</li>
          <li>what to do during exam periods</li>
          <li>how to build habits when your days don't look the same</li>
          <li>how to combine Zwift with running (and real-life biking if you want)</li>
          <li>how to reduce friction so "starting" isn't the hardest part</li>
          <li>how to stay consistent without feeling trapped by a plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          Let's make this something you can actually live with.

      {/* Why Zwift is perfect */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Zwift is perfect for university (if you use it correctly)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift fits student life for one main reason:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          It turns training into a predictable task.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Predictability is everything when your schedule is messy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">With Zwift, you can:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>train in short windows (30–60 minutes)</li>
          <li>avoid weather and daylight problems</li>
          <li>skip travel time</li>
          <li>do structured workouts without needing roads</li>
          <li>stack training next to studying without losing half your day</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That said, Zwift only works for students if you don't treat it like a full-time athlete would.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You need a student-friendly philosophy.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Student philosophy */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The student philosophy: consistency beats "perfect weeks"</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The biggest trap is trying to train like your best fantasy version of yourself.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">You build a plan:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>5 rides per week</li>
          <li>plus runs</li>
          <li>plus strength</li>
          <li>plus "I'll stretch every night"</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Then reality hits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>a surprise assignment</li>
          <li>a lab that runs late</li>
          <li>group members who don't deliver</li>
          <li>a week of bad sleep</li>
          <li>an exam period that deletes your motivation</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And suddenly the plan is "ruined." So you stop.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That's the wrong mindset.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">For students, the goal is:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>keep training alive during busy weeks</li>
          <li>push harder during calm weeks</li>
          <li>avoid all-or-nothing thinking</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you can do that, you'll be fitter after a semester than the person who trained hard for two weeks and then vanished.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Minimum Effective Dose */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Minimum Effective Dose: the secret weapon for busy students</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you want Zwift to survive university, you need a baseline plan that works even when life is chaotic.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here's the simplest truth:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Two Zwift sessions per week can maintain a surprising amount of fitness.<br />
          Three sessions per week can build real progress.<br />
          Anything beyond that is a bonus.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">So instead of asking:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          "How do I find time for 6 sessions?"
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Ask:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          "How do I guarantee 2–3 sessions no matter what?"
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This changes everything.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The "2-session survival week"</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is your exam-period plan, your deadline plan, your "life is too much" plan.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>one shorter hard session (30–50 min)</li>
          <li>one easy endurance session (45–75 min)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That's it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you do only this for a month, you won't peak, but you also won't lose yourself.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And psychologically, it keeps you connected.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Time math */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Time math: where students actually lose time (and how to steal it back)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You don't need to "create" time. You need to stop leaking it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Common student time leaks:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>20-minute breaks that become 90 minutes</li>
          <li>scrolling and "just checking something"</li>
          <li>long, unfocused study sessions</li>
          <li>waiting until late evening to start tasks</li>
          <li>poor sleep causing slow mornings and tired afternoons</li>
          <li>meals with no plan (you lose time deciding + shopping + cooking randomly)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Zwift works best when you treat it like:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>a scheduled appointment</li>
          <li>a reset button</li>
          <li>a transition between study blocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And when you reduce friction around it.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Activation energy */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The real obstacle: not time, but "activation energy"</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most students can find 45 minutes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">The real problem is:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>changing clothes</li>
          <li>setting up</li>
          <li>convincing your brain to start</li>
          <li>feeling guilty that you're not studying</li>
          <li>thinking the session "needs" to be long to count</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That's activation energy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The way to beat it is to make Zwift ridiculously easy to start.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Low-friction setup */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Make Zwift easy to start: the "low-friction setup"</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If your setup takes 10 minutes, you'll skip workouts on busy days.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your goal:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          from decision to pedaling in under 3 minutes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Practical setup wins:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>keep your trainer permanently ready if possible</li>
          <li>keep shoes, bibs/shorts, towel, HR strap in one place</li>
          <li>keep a bottle ready (even just water)</li>
          <li>keep a fan in position</li>
          <li>keep a small mat down (so you're not adjusting everything)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you share living space, you can still do this by creating a "Zwift corner" that resets quickly.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The less you have to think, the more you'll ride.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Guilt problem */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The guilt problem: "I should be studying"</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is one of the biggest issues for student athletes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">You sit down to ride and your mind whispers:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>"You're wasting time."</li>
          <li>"You didn't do enough today."</li>
          <li>"Other people are studying."</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That guilt can kill consistency.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Here's the truth that helps:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          Zwift can make your studying better.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Short training sessions:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>reduce stress</li>
          <li>improve mood</li>
          <li>increase focus afterwards</li>
          <li>help you sleep better</li>
          <li>prevent that "stuck brain" feeling</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But this only works if you use it strategically.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Best way to schedule */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The best way to schedule Zwift with studying</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Students often fail because they try to do Zwift "whenever."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          "Whenever" becomes "never."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Instead, link Zwift to something that already happens in your day.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">Best placement options for students</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>right after lectures (before you sit down at home)</li>
          <li>as a break between two deep study blocks</li>
          <li>late afternoon when focus drops</li>
          <li>early evening before dinner</li>
          <li>morning ride before campus (if you can handle mornings)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Avoid putting Zwift at the very end of the day unless you're a night person. When you're exhausted, activation energy wins.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The "study sandwich" method</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is powerful:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Study block (60–120 min)</li>
          <li>Zwift session (30–60 min)</li>
          <li>Study block (60–120 min)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift becomes the reset in the middle. You stop doom-scrolling because you have a clear "break task." Then you come back sharper.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Exam periods are not the time to chase big fitness gains.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The exam-period rule</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Shorter, consistent sessions beat long heroic sessions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">A good exam-week pattern:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>2 Zwift rides</li>
          <li>1–2 short runs or walks</li>
          <li>all sessions mostly under 60 minutes</li>
          <li>keep intensity controlled</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This keeps your body stable instead of adding extra stress.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The "brain-friendly" exam Zwift sessions</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Best types:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>30–45 min sweet spot (hard but not chaotic)</li>
          <li>40–60 min endurance Z2</li>
          <li>short structured intervals (like 6×2 min) if you enjoy them</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Avoid:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>long races that leave you wrecked</li>
          <li>extreme VO₂ sessions if you're sleep-deprived</li>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Running is the easiest add-on for students:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>shoes are cheap compared to bikes</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But running also adds fatigue.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">If you're cycling-focused and just want general fitness:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>run 1–2 times per week, easy</li>
          <li>keep it short (20–40 min)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">If you're training for triathlon:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>2–4 runs per week, with one being long</li>
          <li>keep most runs easy</li>
          <li>use one short brick run after Zwift once per week</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The safest student combo</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>2–3 Zwift rides per week</li>
          <li>2 runs per week</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The "busy day" workouts that actually work</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is where Zwift is unbeatable.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You don't need 2 hours. You need a session that gives you value fast.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Good 30–45 minute session types:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>short sweet spot blocks (like 2×10 min)</li>
          <li>VO₂ sets like 5×2 min (hard but short)</li>
          <li>endurance spin with a few strong surges</li>
          <li>ramp test-style progressions (not tests, just rising effort)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Good "I'm exhausted but need movement" sessions:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>20–30 min easy spin</li>
          <li>cadence drills</li>
          <li>recovery ride + stretching</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These keep the habit alive.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Staying consistent */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Staying consistent when your week is chaotic</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">A normal student week can look like:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Monday: free</li>
          <li>Tuesday: packed</li>
          <li>Wednesday: random</li>
          <li>Thursday: social</li>
          <li>Friday: exhausted</li>
          <li>weekend: either productive or destroyed</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So stop trying to attach training to specific weekdays.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Instead, attach training to "available windows."
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The 10-day approach for students</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A 10-day training cycle is a student hack.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Instead of forcing everything into Monday–Sunday, you spread:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>2–3 key rides</li>
          <li>2–4 runs</li>
          <li>recovery days</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Across 10 days, it's easier to fit around real life.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This reduces guilt because you're not "missing Tuesday." You're just moving the session to Day 6.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Motivation */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Motivation: the problem isn't laziness, it's mental load</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          On stressful weeks, you're not lazy. You're overloaded.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">So don't rely on motivation.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Rely on:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>routine triggers</li>
          <li>low-friction setup</li>
          <li>minimum effective dose</li>
          <li>small wins</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">Small wins that keep you going</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>"I'll just do 15 minutes."</li>
          <li>"I'll just warm up and see."</li>
          <li>"I'll do an easy spin while watching a lecture replay."</li>
          <li>"I'll do a group ride because it's easier than deciding."</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most workouts begin after you start. The trick is starting.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Food and recovery */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Food and recovery: the student version (simple and cheap)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can't train well at university if your nutrition is chaos.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But you also don't need a perfect diet.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The student fueling basics</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>eat enough carbs on training days (rice, pasta, oats, bread, potatoes)</li>
          <li>get protein daily (eggs, yogurt, tuna, chicken, beans, protein powder if needed)</li>
          <li>don't train hard on an empty stomach all the time</li>
          <li>drink water and use salt/electrolytes for heavy indoor sweating</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">Cheap, fast post-Zwift meals</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>oatmeal + banana + protein powder</li>
          <li>rice + eggs + frozen vegetables</li>
          <li>pasta + tuna + olive oil</li>
          <li>yogurt + cereal + fruit</li>
          <li>sandwich + milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These keep recovery easy.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Social life */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Social life: how to train without becoming boring</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Some students think training means saying no to everything.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That's not sustainable.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Instead:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>use Zwift earlier in the day so evenings are free</li>
          <li>choose shorter sessions on social days</li>
          <li>accept that some weeks are "maintenance weeks"</li>
          <li>remember: you're training for months and years, not for Tuesday night</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">If you have a big social weekend:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>do a Zwift session earlier on the day</li>
          <li>keep it short and controlled</li>
          <li>don't punish yourself the next day</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Consistency survives flexibility.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Tracking */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The one thing you should track as a student athlete</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Forget complex analytics.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Track one thing:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          How many sessions did I do in the last 10 days?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">If the answer is:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>0–1: you're drifting</li>
          <li>2–3: you're maintaining</li>
          <li>4–6: you're building</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This keeps you honest without being obsessive.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Example schedule */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">A realistic example schedule (not rigid, just a model)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Imagine a student week with classes and studying.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Over 10 days, you could aim for:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>3 Zwift rides (1 hard, 1 medium, 1 endurance)</li>
          <li>2–3 runs (mostly easy)</li>
          <li>1 rest day that is truly rest</li>
          <li>optional extra easy spins when you have spare time</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can move sessions around as deadlines change.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That's the whole point.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Mindset */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The mindset that makes it work long-term</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you want time to Zwift during university, don't build a plan that requires perfect weeks.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Build a system that survives imperfect weeks.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your system should include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>a minimum plan you can always do (2 rides per week)</li>
          <li>a normal plan when life is reasonable (3 rides + 2 runs)</li>
          <li>a "bonus plan" when you feel great (extra volume, outdoor rides)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When exams hit, you drop to minimum.<br />
          When exams end, you build again.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No guilt. No restart drama. Just rhythm.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Final takeaway */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Final takeaway</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift is not just "a way to train indoors." For students, it's a way to keep fitness alive through the hardest scheduling environment most people ever experience.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you reduce friction, use minimum effective dose, and stop forcing your training into a perfect weekly calendar, you can train consistently through university—without sacrificing grades, social life, or mental health.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
          You don't need more time.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
          You need a smarter structure.
