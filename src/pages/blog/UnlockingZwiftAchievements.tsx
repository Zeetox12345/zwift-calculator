        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the fun aspects of Zwift (aside from the actual riding) is the built-in achievement system. Zwift loves to reward your milestones – whether it's riding a certain distance, completing a route, or doing something crazy like climbing the height of Everest. These achievements not only give you a sense of accomplishment, but often come with bonus XP or even unlock special gear. In this article, we'll explore the world of <strong>Zwift achievements and badges</strong>, highlight some big ones to aim for, and explain how to unlock the legendary <strong>"Tron bike"</strong> – a glowing neon bike officially called the Zwift Concept Z1, which is basically the ultimate trophy for dedicated Zwifters. If you're a completionist or just looking for extra motivation to ride, chasing these achievements is a great way to keep things interesting!

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Achievement Badges Basics</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift has a wide variety of achievement badges covering all sorts of challenges. You can find them in-game under Menu &gt; Badges. They fall into a few categories: <strong>General Achievements</strong> – These are cumulative or one-time feats like riding a certain distance (e.g. "Ride 100 km in one go"), burning a number of calories, reaching a given wattage, etc. For example, there are badges for riding 10 km, 100 km, even 500 km (the century and double century rides). There's also "Metric Century" (100 km) and "Imperial Century" (100 miles) badges. Other examples: "Ride 7 days in a row" (Addicted badge), "Hit 800 watts" (showing a big sprint), or "Complete a lap of certain routes." Each badge earned gives you a sweet <strong>XP bonus</strong> – typically anywhere from 50 XP for easier ones up to 1000 XP for the really hard ones{" "}

            <em>[1]</em>
          </a>
          . This is great for leveling up faster. In fact, some people purposely chase badges to farm XP. <strong>Route Badges</strong> – Zwift has dozens of routes across its virtual worlds. Every time you complete an <em>official</em> route from start to finish, you'll automatically earn that route's badge (if you haven't before). Routes range from very short (e.g. "Hilly Loop" in Watopia) to insanely long (the "PRL Full" in London, which is 173 km – yes, there's a badge for that!). Each route badge gives bonus XP, often proportional to the route length/difficulty. For example, an easy route might give 100 XP, whereas the biggest routes can award 1000 XP (which is like leveling up a whole level at once in early levels). A popular challenge for dedicated riders is "get all the route badges"{" "}

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Leveling Up and Unlocks</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As you accumulate XP from riding and achievements, you'll <strong>level up</strong> in Zwift. Levels currently go up to 60 (and even beyond to 100, though after 60 the new levels are mostly just extra challenges){" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/points-levels-unlocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[5]</em>
          </a>
          . Higher levels unlock new bikes, wheels, kits, and even access to certain maps (for example, originally you had to be level 10 to access the Jungle circuit, level 12 to do Alpe du Zwift – though these restrictions have eased up some now). So chasing achievements and thus leveling has practical benefits: you can get faster equipment. For instance, a coveted frame like the Specialized Venge or Tron bike requires certain accomplishments. Many frames and wheelsets in the Drop Shop are level-locked until you reach that level{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/points-levels-unlocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[6]</em>
          </a>
          . So leveling up increases your "Zwift street cred" and gear options{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/points-levels-unlocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[6]</em>
          </a>
          . It's worth noting: after level 25, Zwift introduced <strong>Accelerated leveling</strong> to help newer riders catch up faster (earning double XP for a while){" "}

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Big One – Climb Mt. Everest Challenge (Tron Bike)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, let's talk about arguably the most famous accomplishment in Zwift: unlocking the <strong>Tron bike</strong> (Concept Z1). You may have seen riders on Zwift with a bike that has glowing neon wheels (and frame trim) in various colors. That's the Tron bike, and it's special not only because it looks cool, but also because it's one of the faster all-around bikes in game. To get it, you must complete the <strong>"Climb Mt. Everest"</strong> challenge in Zwift – and then some. Specifically: - Go to Menu &gt; Challenges and select <strong>"Climb Mt. Everest"</strong> as your active challenge (if you haven't already). - This challenge first requires you to accumulate <strong>8,848 meters of climbing</strong> – the height of Mt. Everest – over however many rides it takes. When you hit that, you complete the challenge (and get a cool "Everest" badge and a lightweight Trek Emonda bike as a reward). - However, the <strong>Tron bike requires continuing the challenge up to 50,000 meters</strong> of total climbing{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/unlock-the-tron-bike-in-zwift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">

          {" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/unlock-the-tron-bike-in-zwift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[10]</em>
          </a>
          . Yes, you read that right: fifty thousand meters of elevation! That's like climbing Mt. Everest almost 6 times over. It's a <em>huge</em> but achievable long-term goal for active Zwifters.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So basically: <strong>Climb 50,000 m in Zwift while the Everest challenge is selected, and the Tron bike is yours.</strong> This does not need to be one ride (thank goodness). It could take weeks or months, depending how much climbing you do. Some people specifically grind for it by doing lots of Alpe du Zwift repeats (Alpe is ~1,036 m each ascent, so roughly 49 ascents would do it). Others just accumulate over regular rides.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          According to Zwift Insider: "That's right: it takes a total of 50,000 meters (164,042′) of climbing to earn the Tron bike{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/unlock-the-tron-bike-in-zwift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[10]</em>
          </a>
          ." Once reached, you'll get a notification that you unlocked the Zwift Concept Z1 bike, and you can change your bike to it in the garage. A neat feature – you can customize the neon glow color by using the slider for frame color.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A <strong>common pitfall</strong>: Some riders climb a ton but forget to select the Everest challenge, so their meters don't count towards Tron. Make sure you select it and keep it selected until done{" "}
          <a href="https://forums.zwift.com/t/completed-everest-challenge-no-tron-bike-awarded/52470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">
            <em>[11]</em>
          </a>
          . If you complete Everest (8,848 m) and it prompts you to choose a new challenge, don't! Just leave it, and it will keep counting up to 50k (the UI might not show it clearly, but it works). The forums confirm if you leave the challenge selected, it continues counting beyond 100% to 50,000 m{" "}
          <a href="https://forums.zwift.com/t/completed-everest-challenge-no-tron-bike-awarded/52470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">

          .
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Tron grind is real, but many say it's worth it. Not only do you get arguably the coolest bike in game, it's like a badge of honor – you put in the vertical miles to earn it. And along the way, think of all the fitness you build from all that climbing! Pro tip: mix up your climbs to keep it interesting – do some in Watopia (Epic KOM, Alpe), some in France (Ven-Top is a big one), maybe some NYC KOMs, etc.

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Other Notable Achievements</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Route Mastery</strong> – Getting all route badges in a world or overall is a great project. Some are easy, some are truly endurance tests (the PRL Full route in London is a whopping 173 km with 2,300m of climbing – doing that in one session is itself an achievement). <strong>Century and Beyond</strong> – If you've never done 100 km or 100 miles, Zwift is a convenient place to try. You get a badge at the end and a ton of XP. There's also a badge for a 24-hour ride ("Masochist" badge) for the truly insane – ride for 24 hours total (not necessarily moving time, but in one session). Not recommended for most, but it exists. <strong>"Going the Distance" badges</strong> – These are for total distance ridden on Zwift (cumulative across rides). They unlock at huge totals (like 5000 km, etc.). They come naturally as you spend more time in game. <strong>Sprint and KOM jerseys</strong> – Not a badge, but a fun thing – if you get the fastest time through a sprint segment or a KOM while freeriding, you wear the leader's jersey for a while. It's temporary but a cool achievement to snag during a session.

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How to Make the Most of Achievements</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you're looking to gamify your training, use badges as goals. Maybe this week you aim to get the "25 laps of Volcano" badge (there's one for doing 25 laps of the Volcano circuit – talk about mind-numbing, but some do it in group rides). Or decide that over the winter you'll accumulate the Tron bike. Perhaps plan some long Saturday rides to knock out big route badges like Four Horsemen or Uber Pretzel. By having these targets, you'll find motivation to ride longer or tackle harder challenges than you normally would – and that results in improved fitness in the real world too.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Also, engage with the community: lots of folks share their achievement progress on social media or Zwift forums. For example, finishing the Everest challenge and getting the Tron, people often post "Got my Tron today!" with pride (and rightfully so). It's fun to celebrate these milestones with others who understand what it took. You might even find groups dedicated to certain challenges (group "Everest attempts" are a thing).
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zwift's achievement system adds an extra layer of depth to indoor training. It's strangely satisfying to see those badge icons light up after a tough ride, and the extra XP and unlocks give tangible rewards for your efforts{" "}
          <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/badges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-zwift-orange hover:underline">

          . If you're someone who thrives on goals, make a checklist of badges and start ticking them off. You'll likely push yourself to new heights (literally, in the case of the Everest/Tron challenge!). Just remember to enjoy the process – these achievements are about having fun and celebrating progress, not just grinding for a badge. Ride new routes, challenge yourself to go longer or higher, and watch as both your avatar and your real-life fitness level up. And when you finally throw your leg over that glowing Tron bike, take it for a victory lap around Watopia at night – you'll light up the road, in style! 🚴✨
